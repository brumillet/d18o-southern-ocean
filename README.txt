README

This GitHub repository contains 3 different notebooks:

- d18o_ocim_v0: A notebook that was made to look if we could reconstruct the d18o product made by Mark Holzer, which propagated the d18o of the Legrande and Schmidt product of the surface ocean, in the deep ocean. This notebook was made with a previous OCIM output using only 5 surface dyes (LL and MS combined). Here we also how it compares to the d18o SO Giss compilation.

- optimization_fractions: The notebook where we compute the different d18o products and surface values based on the model fractions.

- evaluation_reconstructions: Notebook used to compare the different reconstructions and to compare our results to other studies.
